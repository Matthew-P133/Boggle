# Boggle

Simplified version of the popular word game Boggle, written in Java. 

## Description

The program has a basic Swing GUI and includes functionality such as checking if a word is present (and valid) and highlighting it in the Boggle board accordingly, and a Find All button which prints a list of all valid words in the grid

## Notes

The wordlist used in this program was obtained from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist

## Running the program

Provided you have Java installed, this should simply be a case of downloading the contents of the Boggle folder and compiling them and running GameUI.java. One thing which could cause issues is Dictionary.java being unable to find the 'wordlist' file. If this is the case you may need to update the 'filePath' variable accordingly to get the program to run successfully.
